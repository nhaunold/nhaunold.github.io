			<p>You can include RFC3339-compatible dates in your shortcuts by using the date command. For example: <code>{date:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}</code> will expand to <code id="live-date-1">2012-08-10 01:54:23</code>.</p>

			<a name="documentation-cmd"><h3>Scripting Syntax</h3></a>
			<p>Execute scripts and programs by using the cmd command. For eaxmple: <code>{cmd:/var/mobile/i_am_awesome.sh}</code> will execute the bash script at <code>/var/mobile/i_am_awesome.sh</code> and will insert everything it prints to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
