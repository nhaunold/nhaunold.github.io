      <h2>Hi, I'm Nicolas!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 25-year-old software engineer originally from Vienna, now living
        in Brooklyn. For the past six-ish years I worked at <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I co-founded a legal marketplace startup that connected
        attorneys with potential clients, and developed various iPhone
        apps, software utilities &amp; jailbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day job aside, I enjoy prototyping fun little ideas and side projects,
        though I really spend the majority of my time in the kitchen with friendsâ€”cooking,
        baking, and making espresso.
