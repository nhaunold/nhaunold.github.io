      <h1>Nicolas Haunold</h1>
      <h2>Hi, I'm Nicolas!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 24-year-old software engineer, originally from Vienna, now living
        in San Francisco. For the past five-ish years, I've been with
        <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, where I'm currently on the
        Search team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I co-founded a legal marketplace startup that connected
        attorneys with potential clients, and was involved developing iPhone
        apps, software utilities &amp; jailbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day job aside, I enjoy prototyping fun little ideas and side projects,
        though I really spend the majority of my time in the kitchenâ€”cooking,
        baking, and making espresso with friends.
