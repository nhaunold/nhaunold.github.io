      <h2>Hi, I'm Nicolas!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 26-year-old software engineer born and raised in Vienna, Austria, now living in Brooklyn, New York.
        During the day I spend my time at <a href="https://theinfatuation.com/">The Infatuation</a> & <a href="https://zagat.com">Zagat</a>, before that I was at <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I co-founded a legal marketplace startup that connected
        attorneys with potential clients, and developed various iPhone
        apps, software utilities &amp; jailbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day job aside, I enjoy prototyping fun little ideas and side projects,
        though I really spend the majority of my time in the kitchen with friendsâ€”cooking, learning about making wine, and brewing espresso.
